# Text-Based Emotion Detection for Music Personalization

This project presents a novel approach to music recommendation by leveraging textual data provided by users. The system employs advanced transformer models to detect emotions embedded in user text. By analysing these emotions, the system identifies the user's current mood and emotional state. The process begins with collecting textual data from users, which serves as the input for emotion detection. Transformers, known for their effectiveness in natural language processing, categorize the text into specific emotions. This step ensures an accurate understanding of user sentiments, which is crucial for the recommendation process. Following emotion detection, the system uses content-based filtering techniques to recommend songs that align with the detected emotions and user preferences. Content-based filtering considers the intrinsic attributes of songs, enhancing the relevance of recommendations and personalizing the music experience. By integrating transformer-based emotion detection and content-based filtering, the system dynamically adjusts to the user's emotional state, offering a unique and engaging experience. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the system's effectiveness in capturing user emotions and providing suitable music recommendations, leading to significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction. This research contributes to the field of emotion-aware recommendation systems and advances personalized entertainment services.
